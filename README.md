# Solar Tycoon

Solar Tycoon is an open-source, text-based incremental game where you build and manage a solar energy empire. Buy solar panels, upgrade them, manage system stability, and solve problems to maximize your earnings and grow your business!

## Features
- Buy new solar panels to increase your energy production.
- Upgrade individual panels or all panels at once to boost efficiency.
- Panels age and earn less over time, requiring strategic upgrades.
- System stability can be improved to reduce the chance of problems.
- Problems randomly affect your panels, making them inactive until fixed.
- Softlock detection: If you get stuck, the game offers a restart option.
- Infinite gameplay loopâ€”play as long as you want!

## Gameplay
Each day, you can:
- Buy new solar panels (cost: $500 each)
- Upgrade a specific panel (cost: $200)
- Upgrade all panels at once (cost: $200 per panel)
- Fix problems (cost: $100 per problem)
- Upgrade system stability (cost increases each time)
- End the day to earn money based on active panels and their age

Panel earnings decrease as they age:
- Day 1: $100
- Day 2: $75
- Day 3: $50
- Day 4: $25
- Day 5+: $0

Problems randomly occur and increase with the number of panels. Inactive panels do not earn money until fixed.
